# bin
Random collection of scripts. Chances are if you don't know what you're looking for in this repository, you should probably exercise extra caution in using the scripts in here: They might be poorly (or not at all (yet)!) tested or just not work at all, have very bad code quality, experience unexpected changes or mess things up for you in other ways. Tread carefully.
